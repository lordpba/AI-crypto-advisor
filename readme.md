# AI Crypto Advisor

Welcome to AI Crypto Advisor, your personal assistant for cryptocurrency trading! This Python application uses the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide you with trading advice for cryptocurrencies.

## What does it do?

AI Crypto Advisor takes into consideration various factors such as your preferred cryptocurrency, initial capital, risk tolerance, trading strategy preference, and even the impact of news on the market. It then processes this information to provide you with the best possible trading advice.

## How does it work?

The application uses a 'crew' of AI models that work together to analyze the market and make predictions. This crew takes in your inputs and executes a series of complex calculations and predictions. This process might take some time, but the result is worth the wait!

Once the crew has finished its execution, the final result is displayed in a user-friendly format. This result contains the trading advice generated by the AI models based on your inputs.
